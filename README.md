# BackwardDataPassingUsingProtocols


**BackwardDataPassingUsingProtocols** is a simple iOS application built using Swift and UIKit. This project demonstrates the implementation of backward data passing between view controllers using the delegate pattern.  

## Features ->  

- **Data Passing:** Pass data seamlessly from the second view controller back to the first view controller using the delegate pattern.  
- **User Input Handling:** Collect user data (first name) through a text field on the second screen.  
- **Dynamic UI Updates:** Automatically update the label on the first screen with the data passed back.  
- **Navigation Controller:** Navigate between view controllers with smooth transitions.  

## How It Works ->  

1. **Protocol Definition:** A protocol is created to define a method for data passing.  
2. **Delegate Property:** A property of the protocol is defined in the second view controller.  
3. **Conformance:** The first view controller conforms to the protocol and implements the required method.  
4. **Data Passing:** The second view controller uses the delegate property to pass data back to the first view controller.  

This app is a great example of how to use the delegate pattern for communication between view controllers in iOS.
